        <em><strong>1.9.3, 2.0, 3.0 Only - UNIX Only - I was unable to upgrade successfully to version </strong><strong>3.0. How do I restore Post.Office from my standard, full system backup files?</strong></em>

After your system is restored and working, please contact  We will need to evaluate your problem and then assist you with the 3.0 upgrade.

<strong>Restoration Instructions for Solaris</strong><strong>:</strong>

If you attempted to install the 3.0 release of Post.Office and received the following error message:

pkgadd: ERROR: preinstall script did not complete successfully

Installation of &lt;SCOM-MTA&gt; failed.

you will be left in the pkgadd utility. Please type quit or it could attempt your conversion again. This message indicates that the conversion of your account database did not succeed.

The easiest way to restore is if you have made a total backup of your Post.Office including:
<ul>
 	<li>Post.Office Spooling and Configuration information: &lt;/var/spool/&gt;Post.Office</li>
 	<li>Post.Office Mailbox information: &lt;/var/spool/&gt;Mailbox</li>
 	<li>Your Configuration File: /etc/post.office.conf</li>
</ul>
Assuming you took that precaution (as instructed in the README.TXT and RELNOTES.TXT files), please:
<ol>
 	<li>If Post.Office is running please shut it down by typing:
&lt;/opt&gt;/Post.Office shutdown</li>
 	<li>Copy the existing, half-upgraded versions of the directories and files listed above to another location before attempting restoration.</li>
 	<li>Restore the two file system directories containing Post.Office Spooling and Configuration information and Post.Office Mailbox information, as well as the Configuration file from your backup on top of the existing half- upgraded versions.
Note: You might run into ownership or permission problems if you didn’t back up or restore with the original permissions. It’s possible that executing a chown on the copied files and assigning ownership to your post.office user (mta) will be enough. (The standard permissions for UNIX are listed elsewhere in this FAQ for your review.)</li>
 	<li>Remove the 3.0 executables with pkgrm:
pkgrm SCOM-MTA</li>
 	<li>Download the version of Post.Office for Solaris that you were running prior to the upgrade (1.9.3 or 2.0) from our web site to a temporary directory.
bin
get &lt;packagename&gt;.tar.Z</li>
 	<li>Uncompress the file you downloaded and expand the resulting archive file to create the Post.Office package (SCOM-MTA) by typing :

cd /var/tmp/PO&lt;version&gt;

uncompress &lt;packagename&gt;.tar.Z
tar xvpf &lt;packgename&gt;.tar</li>
 	<li>From the location in which you stored it, install the package by typing:

pkgadd -d . SCOM-MTA

<strong>Caution:</strong> The upgrade program will ask if you wish to change configuration information. You should answer "no".</li>
 	<li>If you are currently using Program Delivery you may need to re-enable that feature by typing:</li>
</ol>
chmod u+s /opt/post.office/local/Program-Deliver

rm /opt/post.office/trusted/NO-PROGRAM-DELIVERIES
<ol start="9">
 	<li>Run the Post.Office configuration program:</li>
</ol>
For 1.9.3: /opt/post.office/Install

For 2.0: /opt/post.office/Setup

This will restore your account information and upgrade your executables back to your prior version of Post.Office.

<strong>Restoration Instructions for SunOS/Irix</strong><strong>:</strong>

The easiest way to restore is if you have made a total backup of your Post.Office including:
<ul>
 	<li>Post.Office Executables: &lt;/usr/local//&gt;Post.Office</li>
 	<li>Post.Office Spooling and Configuration information: &lt;/var/spool/&gt;Post.Office</li>
 	<li>Post.Office Mailbox information: &lt;/var/spool/&gt;Mailbox</li>
 	<li>Your Configuration File: /etc/post.office.conf</li>
</ul>
Assuming you took that precaution (as instructed in the README.TXT and RELNOTES.TXT files), please:
<ol>
 	<li>If Post.Office is running shut it down by typing:
&lt;/usr&gt;/local/Post.Office shutdown</li>
 	<li>Copy the existing, half-upgraded versions of the directories and files listed above to another location before attempting restoration.</li>
 	<li>Restore the three file system directories containing Post.Office Executables, Post.Office Spooling and Configuration information, and Post.Office Mailbox information, as well as the configuration file from your backup on top of the existing half- upgraded versions.</li>
</ol>
<em>Note: You might run into permission problems if you didn’t backup or restore with the </em><em>original permissions. The standard permissions for UNIX are listed elsewhere in this FAQ </em><em>for your review. Once you are restored and your permissions are properly set, start the </em><em>Post.Office server (i.e. &lt;/usr/local/&gt;Post.Office/Post.Office startup).</em> </section>
